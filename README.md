This is my learning repository consisting test cases done on https://www.saucedemo.com/ and https://testpages.eviltester.com/ using ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robot%20Framework-white?logo=robotframework&logoColor=black) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Selenium-white?logo=selenium) via Raid test data editor.
All test casees where designed by me based on what I've learned about page. Project will be enlarged without Raid as I find it limitations quite annoying.
